    <p class="tool-description">
        YouTube tags are keywords added to your video that help the algorithm understand your content. They improve your video’s discoverability by matching it with user search queries. Effective tagging boosts SEO and increases your reach. Tags like “how to”, “tutorial”, or niche-related terms help rank better. Use relevant, high-volume keywords to get noticed. Never spam unrelated tags. Let your tags reflect your content authentically.
