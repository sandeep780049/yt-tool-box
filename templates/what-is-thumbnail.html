<h1 class="info-title">What is a YouTube Thumbnail?</h1>
<p class="info-desc">
  A YouTube thumbnail is the preview image of your video. Itâ€™s the first thing viewers see, so it plays a huge role in whether they click or skip. A clear, colorful, and attention-grabbing thumbnail improves your click-through rate (CTR).
</p>
<p class="info-desc">
  Use big fonts, high contrast, and faces/emotions when possible. Custom thumbnails often perform better than auto-generated ones.
